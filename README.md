# AI Playground

A collection of experimental projects exploring AI algorithms and mathematical concepts, all running in the browser and deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Projects

### [Cockroach Simulation](https://egapool.github.io/ai-playground/cockroach/)

A fascinating simulation that models cockroach behavior, demonstrating swarm intelligence and photophobic responses. Watch as virtual cockroaches exhibit emergent behavior patterns and react to environmental stimuli.

### [Langton's Ant](https://egapool.github.io/ai-playground/langtons-ant/)

An implementation of the classic cellular automaton invented by Christopher Langton. This project demonstrates how complex patterns can emerge from simple rules, creating an intriguing visual representation of mathematical principles.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 Canvas for dynamic rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript for computation and animation
- CSS3 for styling and layout

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository

```bash
