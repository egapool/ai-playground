# Stag Beetle Style Predator and Prey Simulation

This project is an interactive ecosystem simulation that runs in a web browser. It features predators (styled as stag beetles) and prey (small insects), with the predators having a starvation feature.

## Features

- **Dynamic Canvas Size**: The canvas size adjusts according to the browser window size.
- **Creature Generation and Behavior**: Predators and prey move around on the canvas. Predators face the risk of starvation and will die if they do not eat within a certain time.
- **Interactions**: Press the space key to add new predators to the simulation.
- **Natural Movements**: Creatures move randomly or with purpose. Predators chase prey, and prey flee from predators.

## Technologies Used
